# Troubleshooting

Common failures and the fix. When in doubt, run:

```sh
aipager doctor
```

It runs every check below in order and prints the canonical fix
hint for each failure. Source: `aipager/doctor.py`.

## "Another aipager daemon already owns the socket"

Two daemons can't share one control socket. It lives at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aipager.sock` under the systemd service (falls back
to `/tmp/aipager.sock` when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset). If a
previous daemon crashed without unlinking, the new one detects the
stale socket and exits.

```sh
pkill -f 'aipager start'
rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/aipager.sock"
aipager start
```

Or, if you're using the service unit:

```sh
aipager service stop
aipager service start
```

## Telegram bot doesn't respond

1. `aipager status` — is the daemon up? If "daemon down" → start it.
2. `aipager doctor` — the `check_token_valid` and
   `check_chat_reachable` checks ping the Telegram API end-to-end
   and surface the exact error.
3. Wrong chat ID: re-run `aipager config` and re-enter the chat ID
   (open the bot in Telegram, send any message, then check
   `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`).
4. Bot was never `/start`ed: open the bot in Telegram and tap Start
   once.

## Busy cards got slower

Telegram allows roughly one message a second into any one chat (and 20 a
minute into a group). Every call counts: sends and edits alike. The
daemon gives each chat its own budget of about 1 call a second, with a
small burst, and the busy cards of that chat **share** it. (A busy card
no longer sends a "typing…" indicator: the card is the progress display,
and the indicator cost a second call on every refresh — half the chat's
budget, for something the card already tells you.)

So with two sessions working in the same chat, each card refreshes about
every 2.2 seconds instead of every 1.2; with three, about every 3.3. **A
slower card is the budget working, not a bug.** Answers, replies and
button responses are never slowed to make room for a card — they keep a
reserved token, and a card edit that cannot afford a call is simply
skipped and retried on the next tick rather than queued in front of your
answer.

In a **group** the limit is 20 calls a minute however many sessions are
in it, so a card there refreshes every 3.3 seconds whatever else is going
on.

To speed the cards up: run fewer simultaneous sessions per chat, or give
the busiest ones a chat of their own (`aipager config`). You can also
tune `STREAM_EDIT_INTERVAL` (default `1.2`, the cadence while the card is
streaming text) and `BUSY_EDIT_INTERVAL` (default `3.0`, when it is
quiet) in your config. Setting either *below* the per-chat floor is
harmless and changes nothing — the floor wins, which is what keeps the
chat under Telegram's limit whatever you put in the file.

## The bot slowed down: a rate limit (429)

If Telegram rate-limits a chat anyway, it answers one call with `429` and
a `retry_after` of a few seconds. The daemon stops calling that chat for
exactly that long, makes the one deferred send again afterwards, and
**doubles that chat's card interval** (up to ×8). Each quiet minute halves
it back to normal.

What you see:

- `aipager status` (and the `aipager daemon` row of `aipager doctor`)
  shows **`Telegram flood backoff ×4 (chat …), last 429 12 s ago`**.
- Exactly one line in `aipager logs`, with no traceback:
  `flood: chat … 429 retry_after=5s → cadence ×2`.
- Nothing is muted, and **no answer is lost** — it is deferred, not
  dropped.

Nothing to do. It clears itself. The backoff line disappears once the
chat has been quiet for a minute or two, and `aipager doctor` keeps the
daemon row green throughout: a chat backing off is normal operation.

## The bot went quiet: flood control

A `retry_after` past `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER` (default 90 s) is not a
rate limit — it is a **ban**, and it can run to hours. From the chat it
looks like the bot died: prompts still reach Claude, sessions keep
working, but no reply comes back.

What you see:

- `aipager status` (and the `aipager daemon` row of `aipager doctor`)
  shows **`Telegram flood-muted until HH:MM (chat …)`**.
- One line in `aipager logs`: `Telegram flood control — chat … muted
  for Ns (until HH:MM) …`, then silence for that chat. Later, one
  `flood mute on chat … lifted` line.
- A 🚨 reaction on your message when the answer to it was dropped.

The daemon mutes the chat for exactly the time Telegram asked and skips
every send to it — answers, busy-card edits, attachments, and the replies
your own commands and button taps would have produced — instead of
retrying into the ban, because each retry (and each plain-text fallback)
is a fresh violation that extends it. A command typed during a mute
therefore answers with nothing at all; a button tap still gets its toast,
which Telegram meters separately. Answers produced during the mute
are not queued; ask again once it lifts. Other chats are unaffected.

What NOT to do:

- Don't restart the daemon to "fix" it. The mute self-clears at the
  time shown; a restart forgets it and sends one more attempt into the
  ban, which can extend it.
- Don't lower `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER` below the default 90 s hoping
  to retry sooner — everything past that cap is a ban, not a rate limit.

To avoid it: run fewer simultaneous sessions per chat, or give the
busiest ones a chat of their own (`aipager config`).

## Session shows GONE in pinned status

The dtach process for that session exited (machine reboot,
`pkill claude`, user typed `exit` in the dtach attach session).
Recreate from scratch — its `~/.claude/projects/...` directory still
has the conversation:

The easiest path is `/resume <label>` in Telegram (or bare
`/resume` for a picker) — it relaunches the session and picks the
conversation back up. From the CLI:

```sh
aipager resume <label>             # same thing from the terminal
aipager session <label>            # or a fresh session, no history
aipager session <label> --resume   # fresh dtach, resumed conversation
```

## Permission prompt stuck on INTERACTIVE

If a session sits in INTERACTIVE with no hook activity for >5 min,
the session monitor auto-demotes it to BUSY and clears the pending
permission. This catches the case where claude code crashed
mid-prompt and the user can never respond.

Tune the timeout:

```sh
AIPAGER_INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT=300 aipager start    # in seconds
```

## Voice extra won't install via Telegram

The `[📦 Install voice]` button runs an installer subprocess and
streams the result. If the install fails, the bot replies with the
last 500 chars of stderr. Common causes:

- Network: pip can't reach PyPI. Check connectivity from the daemon
  host.
- Disk: `~/.cache/huggingface/` needs ~74 MB for the model and
  pip's wheel cache another ~250 MB. Free space first.
- Permission denied: read-only venv. Switch to `uv tool install`
  which always uses a user-owned venv.

If the bot lost connection mid-install, the install itself usually
completed on the host — restart the daemon and try a voice message
again.

## Open App shows "Open this page from the Telegram app to sign in"

The page loaded, but Telegram's Mini App SDK script (the one that
produces `initData`) did not, so the page has nothing to sign in with
and makes no API call at all. The message blames you; the cause is a
network one.

Recent versions of aipager fetch that script themselves and serve it
from the page's own origin (`/telegram-web-app.js`), so the phone only
needs to reach the host that delivered the page — not `telegram.org` as
well. If you see this on an older version, upgrade.

Then, in order:

1. Look at the page source. If its `<script>` tag points at
   `https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js`, the daemon has not
   managed to fetch the script yet and the page is falling back to
   loading it from Telegram — which is the case that fails on a phone
   that cannot reach `telegram.org`. The daemon fetches it when the Mini
   App server starts and retries at most once a day, so restarting the
   daemon retries immediately; `journalctl --user -u aipager | grep
   "webapp sdk"` says what went wrong (a blocked or filtered
   `telegram.org`, usually).
2. If the tag points at `/telegram-web-app.js`, check the daemon serves
   it: `curl -sI http://127.0.0.1:8765/telegram-web-app.js` on the
   daemon host (adjust the port if you changed it) should answer `200`
   with `Content-Type: application/javascript`. The copy lives under
   `~/.local/share/aipager/webapp-sdk/`.
3. You opened the URL in a regular browser rather than from the bot's
   `/app` button or menu button: that is the expected message. The SDK
   only produces `initData` inside Telegram.
4. The page was left open for more than five minutes: `initData`
   expires and the page asks to be reopened. Tap `/app` again.

## `pyexpat _XML_SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold` on brew install

Homebrew's `python@3.12` bottle was compiled against a newer
libexpat than your system has — almost always because **Xcode and
Command Line Tools are out of date** on macOS Tahoe (26.x). Brew's
own output usually tells you so. Two fixes:

- **Use `uv tool install aipager`** instead. uv bundles its own
  python, dodging the issue entirely. This is the recommended path
  on macOS — see the [README](../README.md#install).
- **Update Xcode + Command Line Tools**:
  ```sh
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install
  ```
  Or open Xcode in the App Store and update to the latest.

## "ModuleNotFoundError: aipager"

Your daemon binary references a Python that no longer has aipager
installed (often after a venv wipe). Reinstall:

```sh
uv tool install --reinstall aipager
# or whichever installer you started with: pipx, brew, pip
```

## Daemon crashes on boot with `KeyError` in `state.py`

State file got corrupted (interrupted write). The daemon doesn't
auto-recover destructive corruption — restore the latest backup:

```sh
ls -la ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json.bak.*
# pick the most recent, then:
cp ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json.bak.<timestamp> \
   ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json
aipager start
```

If no backup is recoverable, you can safely delete the state file —
the daemon will recover live sessions by scanning
`/tmp/claude-dtach-*.sock` on first monitor tick.

## A session launch fails

A launch dtach refuses shows a one-line reason in chat (socket already
exists, shell not executable, no pseudo-terminal, name too long,
permission denied, missing directory); dtach's own message, paths
included, is in `aipager logs`.

## `aipager doctor` check list

The order matters — each later check assumes earlier ones passed.
A check that crashes on an unexpected environment shows as a single
⚠ row naming the check and the error; the remaining checks still run.

| Check | What it verifies | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|
| `check_config` | `~/.config/aipager/aipager.yaml` exists and has token + chat ID | `aipager config` |
| `check_token_valid` | Token works against Telegram `getMe` | re-run `aipager config` |
| `check_chat_reachable` | Bot can send to the configured chat | open bot, tap Start |
| `check_dtach` | `dtach` binary on PATH | `uv tool install --reinstall aipager` |
| `check_claude` | Resolves the `claude` binary via the same precedence chain every launch uses (`claude_path` config → `$AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` → `~/.local/bin` → PATH → Homebrew), and lists every OTHER distinct install found | install Claude Code, or set `claude_path` / `AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` |
| `check_claude_auth` | Probes `claude auth status` in the same environment a real session gets. **Never FAILs** — "not logged in" and "the probe itself failed" are reported distinctly, and neither stops a session from launching | `claude auth login`, or set an API key / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` |
| `check_settings_json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` has the aipager hooks wired up | `aipager config` |
| `check_hook_scripts` | `aipager-hook` and `aipager-statusline` are on PATH | `uv tool install --reinstall aipager` |
| `check_daemon` | Daemon is running and socket is responsive | `aipager start` |
| `check_service_installed` | Optional: service unit is present | `aipager service install` |
| `check_service_unit_path` | Linux only: the *installed* unit's `Environment=PATH=` actually contains the resolved claude binary's directory — parsed as text, since doctor cannot see systemd's own PATH from the operator's interactive shell | `aipager service install --yes` |

Run `aipager doctor --fix` to interactively discover/copy a Claude
credential into `daemon.env`, or pin `claude_path` when multiple
installs are found (or the unit's PATH disagrees with the resolved
one). It only ever acts after asking.

## The daemon can't find `claude`, or picks the wrong install

Six places used to resolve `claude` independently and could disagree
with each other. They now all go through one resolver
(`aipager/claude_resolve.py`), in this order: `claude_path` in
`aipager.yaml` → `$AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` → `~/.local/bin/claude` →
every `claude` on `$PATH` → the fixed Homebrew prefixes. Run
`aipager doctor` to see exactly which one it picked and what else it
found; if the wrong one wins, either fix `$PATH` for the process that
launches aipager, or pin the right one explicitly:

```sh
aipager doctor --fix        # interactive picker among discovered installs
# or by hand:
echo 'claude_path: /home/you/.local/bin/claude' >> ~/.config/aipager/aipager.yaml
```

## Sessions can't authenticate under the systemd service, but `claude` works fine in a terminal

`systemctl --user` units never source `~/.bashrc` / `~/.profile`, so
an `export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=…` line there never reaches the
daemon. The service unit instead uses systemd's `LoadCredential=`,
reading `~/.config/aipager/daemon.env` — a plain `KEY=VALUE` file,
0600, created automatically the first time you run
`aipager service install` (copied forward from a legacy `config.env`
if one held a token, otherwise discovered from your login shell once,
otherwise left empty with a warning).

```sh
cat ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env          # see what's there (or isn't)
echo 'CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-...' >> ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env
chmod 600 ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env
aipager service stop && aipager service start
```

See [Security model — The Claude credential](security.md#the-claude-credential--what-actually-protects-it)
for what this file does and doesn't protect against.

## The daemon's control socket moved

`aipager doctor` / `aipager status` used to always look at
`/tmp/aipager.sock`. Under the systemd service the control socket now
lives at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aipager.sock` (falling back to `/tmp` only
when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset — containers, WSL1, minimal distros).
Only this one socket moved; per-session dtach sockets
(`/tmp/claude-dtach-*.sock`) are unaffected. Override with
`AIPAGER_SOCKET_PATH` if you need a specific location.

## Still stuck?

Open an issue at
[github.com/dev-aly3n/aipager/issues](https://github.com/dev-aly3n/aipager/issues)
and include the output of `aipager doctor` plus the last ~50 lines
of `aipager logs`.
