# Troubleshooting

Common failures and the fix. When in doubt, run:

```sh
aipager doctor
```

It runs every check below in order and prints the canonical fix
hint for each failure. Source: `aipager/doctor.py`.

## "Another aipager daemon already owns the socket"

Two daemons can't share one control socket. It lives at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aipager.sock` under the systemd service (falls back
to `/tmp/aipager.sock` when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset). If a
previous daemon crashed without unlinking, the new one detects the
stale socket and exits.

```sh
pkill -f 'aipager start'
rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/aipager.sock"
aipager start
```

Or, if you're using the service unit:

```sh
aipager service stop
aipager service start
```

## Telegram bot doesn't respond

1. `aipager status` — is the daemon up? If "daemon down" → start it.
2. `aipager doctor` — the `check_token_valid` and
   `check_chat_reachable` checks ping the Telegram API end-to-end
   and surface the exact error.
3. Wrong chat ID: re-run `aipager config` and re-enter the chat ID
   (open the bot in Telegram, send any message, then check
   `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`).
4. Bot was never `/start`ed: open the bot in Telegram and tap Start
   once.

## Busy cards got slower

Telegram allows roughly one message a second into any one chat (and 20 a
minute into a group). Every message and every edit counts. The daemon
gives each chat its own budget of about 1 call a second, with a small
burst, and the busy cards of that chat **share** it. (The "typing…"
indicator is *not* in that budget — Telegram does not count chat actions
with messages, which is measured, not assumed — so a working session
shows the bubble in your chat list without ever slowing its card. It is
refreshed on its own schedule, every 4.5 seconds per working session,
because Telegram clears a typing status after 5; `TYPING_INDICATOR_INTERVAL`
tunes that, and `0` turns the bubble off.)

So with two sessions working in the same chat, each card refreshes about
every 2.2 seconds instead of every 1.2; with three, about every 3.3. **A
slower card is the budget working, not a bug.** Answers, replies and
button responses are never slowed to make room for a card — they keep a
reserved token, and a card edit that cannot afford a call is simply
skipped and retried on the next tick rather than queued in front of your
answer.

In a **group** the limit is 20 calls a minute however many sessions are
in it, so a card there refreshes every 3.3 seconds whatever else is going
on.

To speed the cards up: run fewer simultaneous sessions per chat, or give
the busiest ones a chat of their own (`aipager config`). You can also
tune `STREAM_EDIT_INTERVAL` (default `1.2`, the cadence while the card is
streaming text) and `BUSY_EDIT_INTERVAL` (default `3.0`, when it is
quiet) in your config. Setting either *below* the per-chat floor is
harmless and changes nothing — the floor wins, which is what keeps the
chat under Telegram's limit whatever you put in the file.

None of this affects the "typing…" bubble. It has a schedule of its own,
one refresh every `TYPING_INDICATOR_INTERVAL` seconds (default 4.5) for as
long as a session is working, however slow that session's card happens to
be — so a chat with three busy sessions refreshes the bubble exactly as
often as a chat with one, while its cards refresh every 3.3 seconds.
Telegram clears a typing status after 5 seconds, which is why the default
sits just under that; setting it higher leaves gaps between refreshes.

## The bot slowed down: a rate limit (429)

If Telegram rate-limits a chat anyway, it answers one call with `429` and
a `retry_after` of a few seconds. The daemon stops calling that chat for
exactly that long, makes the one deferred send again afterwards, and
**doubles that chat's card interval** (up to ×8). Each quiet minute halves
it back to normal.

What you see:

- `aipager status` (and the `aipager daemon` row of `aipager doctor`)
  shows **`Telegram flood backoff ×4 (chat …), last 429 12 s ago`**.
- Exactly one line in `aipager logs`, with no traceback:
  `flood: chat … 429 retry_after=5s → cadence ×2`.
- Nothing is muted, and **no answer is lost** — it is deferred, not
  dropped.
- The chat's **earned send rate halves**, and `aipager status` shows it:
  `Telegram chat 123: rate 0.25/s, 7/30 in the last minute`.

Nothing to do. It clears itself. The rate climbs back by 0.1 calls/s for
every quiet minute, the backoff line disappears once the chat has been
quiet for a minute or two, and `aipager doctor` keeps the daemon row
green throughout: a chat backing off is normal operation.

### The earned rate, and why your cards may be slower than they were

Since 0.7.13 each chat's sustained send rate is **learned rather than
assumed**. Telegram does not publish the limit that actually applies to
your bot — it depends on your account's recent history — so the daemon
starts each chat at 0.5 calls/s, adds 0.1 for every quiet minute up to a
ceiling of 1/s, halves it on a 429 and drops it to 0.05 after a ban. A
bot that has just been banned is therefore paced far more carefully than
one that has not, and it earns its speed back over the following hours.

If a chat's rate falls below 0.2 calls/s it enters **minimal mode**: busy
cards stop animating and show one static `⏳ working — updates paused`
line, the typing bubble stops, and the pinned dashboard stops refreshing.
**Answers, replies and permission prompts keep flowing** — that is the
point. The card is about 95 % of what this bot sends and the answer about
5 %, so under pressure it sheds pixels rather than work. `aipager doctor`
reports minimal mode as a warning so a paused card is never mistaken for
a broken one; it lifts by itself as the rate recovers.

## The bot went quiet: flood control

A `retry_after` past `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER` (default 90 s) is not a
rate limit — it is a **ban**, and it can run to hours. From the chat it
looks like the bot died: prompts still reach Claude, sessions keep
working, but no reply comes back.

What you see:

- `aipager status` (and the `aipager daemon` row of `aipager doctor`)
  shows **`Telegram flood-muted until HH:MM (chat …)`**.
- One line in `aipager logs`: `Telegram flood control — chat … muted
  for Ns (until HH:MM) …`, then silence for that chat. Later, one
  `flood mute on chat … lifted` line.
- `aipager status` also shows the chat's state in full:
  `Telegram chat 123: rate 0.05/s — MINIMAL MODE, card updates paused —
  flood-muted until 09:41 (1 ban(s) in the last 24 h)`.

The daemon mutes the chat for exactly the time Telegram asked and makes
**no call of any kind** to it — answers, busy-card edits, attachments,
reactions, typing indicators, button-tap toasts and the replies your
commands would have produced. Each one would be a fresh violation that
extends the ban; a request into an active ban is what turned a 21-minute
ban into a 9.5-hour one on 2026-09-15. A command typed during a mute
therefore answers with nothing at all, and **a button tap is not
acknowledged either** — up to 0.7.12 the toast still fired, on the theory
that Telegram meters it separately. It does, for pacing; it does not for
bans. Other chats are unaffected.

**Answers are not lost.** An answer produced while the chat is muted is
held and delivered once the ban lifts, within a couple of seconds, with
its first line reading `⏳ delivered late (held 42 min during a Telegram
rate limit)`. You do not need to ask again — and if you did ask again,
both answers arrive, oldest first: a ban lasting hours spans several
turns and each one's answer is yours. (Held answers live in memory: if
you restart the daemon while any are waiting, they are lost — the
shutdown log says how many. A chat holds at most 20, and nothing older
than 24 hours; anything dropped for either reason is a warning in the
log naming what it was.)

**A ban makes the chat slower afterwards, not faster.** The moment a ban
is armed the chat's learned rate drops to the floor and the ban is
counted; the muted hours earn nothing back, the climb restarts from the
moment the ban lifts, and for 24 hours after a ban the chat may climb to
only half its normal ceiling. `aipager status` shows all of it.

What NOT to do:

- Don't restart the daemon to "fix" it. The mute self-clears at the time
  shown. Since 0.7.13 a restart no longer forgets the ban — the deadline,
  the chat's earned rate and its ban history are persisted to
  `~/.claude/aipager-flood-state.json` and restored on start — so
  restarting no longer extends it either. But it will throw away any
  answers still held, and it fixes nothing.
- Don't lower `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER` below the default 90 s hoping
  to retry sooner — everything past that cap is a ban, not a rate limit.

To avoid it: run fewer simultaneous sessions per chat, or give the
busiest ones a chat of their own (`aipager config`).

## Session shows GONE in pinned status

The dtach process for that session exited (machine reboot,
`pkill claude`, user typed `exit` in the dtach attach session).
Recreate from scratch — its `~/.claude/projects/...` directory still
has the conversation:

The easiest path is `/resume <label>` in Telegram (or bare
`/resume` for a picker) — it relaunches the session and picks the
conversation back up. From the CLI:

```sh
aipager resume <label>             # same thing from the terminal
aipager session <label>            # or a fresh session, no history
aipager session <label> --resume   # fresh dtach, resumed conversation
```

## Permission prompt stuck on INTERACTIVE

If a session sits in INTERACTIVE with no hook activity for >5 min,
the session monitor auto-demotes it to BUSY and clears the pending
permission. This catches the case where claude code crashed
mid-prompt and the user can never respond.

Tune the timeout:

```sh
AIPAGER_INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT=300 aipager start    # in seconds
```

## Voice extra won't install via Telegram

The `[📦 Install voice]` button runs an installer subprocess and
streams the result. If the install fails, the bot replies with the
last 500 chars of stderr. Common causes:

- Network: pip can't reach PyPI. Check connectivity from the daemon
  host.
- Disk: `~/.cache/huggingface/` needs ~74 MB for the model and
  pip's wheel cache another ~250 MB. Free space first.
- Permission denied: read-only venv. Switch to `uv tool install`
  which always uses a user-owned venv.

If the bot lost connection mid-install, the install itself usually
completed on the host — restart the daemon and try a voice message
again.

## Open App shows "Open this page from the Telegram app to sign in"

The page loaded, but Telegram's Mini App SDK script (the one that
produces `initData`) did not, so the page has nothing to sign in with
and makes no API call at all. The message blames you; the cause is a
network one.

Recent versions of aipager fetch that script themselves and serve it
from the page's own origin (`/telegram-web-app.js`), so the phone only
needs to reach the host that delivered the page — not `telegram.org` as
well. If you see this on an older version, upgrade.

Then, in order:

1. Look at the page source. If its `<script>` tag points at
   `https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js`, the daemon has not
   managed to fetch the script yet and the page is falling back to
   loading it from Telegram — which is the case that fails on a phone
   that cannot reach `telegram.org`. The daemon fetches it when the Mini
   App server starts and retries at most once a day, so restarting the
   daemon retries immediately; `journalctl --user -u aipager | grep
   "webapp sdk"` says what went wrong (a blocked or filtered
   `telegram.org`, usually).
2. If the tag points at `/telegram-web-app.js`, check the daemon serves
   it: `curl -sI http://127.0.0.1:8765/telegram-web-app.js` on the
   daemon host (adjust the port if you changed it) should answer `200`
   with `Content-Type: application/javascript`. The copy lives under
   `~/.local/share/aipager/webapp-sdk/`.
3. You opened the URL in a regular browser rather than from the bot's
   `/app` button or menu button: that is the expected message. The SDK
   only produces `initData` inside Telegram.
4. The page was left open for more than five minutes: `initData`
   expires and the page asks to be reopened. Tap `/app` again.

## `pyexpat _XML_SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold` on brew install

Homebrew's `python@3.12` bottle was compiled against a newer
libexpat than your system has — almost always because **Xcode and
Command Line Tools are out of date** on macOS Tahoe (26.x). Brew's
own output usually tells you so. Two fixes:

- **Use `uv tool install aipager`** instead. uv bundles its own
  python, dodging the issue entirely. This is the recommended path
  on macOS — see the [README](../README.md#install).
- **Update Xcode + Command Line Tools**:
  ```sh
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install
  ```
  Or open Xcode in the App Store and update to the latest.

## "ModuleNotFoundError: aipager"

Your daemon binary references a Python that no longer has aipager
installed (often after a venv wipe). Reinstall:

```sh
uv tool install --reinstall aipager
# or whichever installer you started with: pipx, brew, pip
```

## Daemon crashes on boot with `KeyError` in `state.py`

State file got corrupted (interrupted write). The daemon doesn't
auto-recover destructive corruption — restore the latest backup:

```sh
ls -la ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json.bak.*
# pick the most recent, then:
cp ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json.bak.<timestamp> \
   ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json
aipager start
```

If no backup is recoverable, you can safely delete the state file —
the daemon will recover live sessions by scanning
`/tmp/claude-dtach-*.sock` on first monitor tick.

## A session launch fails

A launch dtach refuses shows a one-line reason in chat (socket already
exists, shell not executable, no pseudo-terminal, name too long,
permission denied, missing directory); dtach's own message, paths
included, is in `aipager logs`.

## `aipager doctor` check list

The order matters — each later check assumes earlier ones passed.
A check that crashes on an unexpected environment shows as a single
⚠ row naming the check and the error; the remaining checks still run.

| Check | What it verifies | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|
| `check_config` | `~/.config/aipager/aipager.yaml` exists and has token + chat ID | `aipager config` |
| `check_token_valid` | Token works against Telegram `getMe` | re-run `aipager config` |
| `check_chat_reachable` | Bot can send to the configured chat | open bot, tap Start |
| `check_dtach` | `dtach` binary on PATH | `uv tool install --reinstall aipager` |
| `check_claude` | Resolves the `claude` binary via the same precedence chain every launch uses (`claude_path` config → `$AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` → `~/.local/bin` → PATH → Homebrew), and lists every OTHER distinct install found | install Claude Code, or set `claude_path` / `AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` |
| `check_claude_auth` | Probes `claude auth status` in the same environment a real session gets. **Never FAILs** — "not logged in" and "the probe itself failed" are reported distinctly, and neither stops a session from launching | `claude auth login`, or set an API key / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` |
| `check_settings_json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` has the aipager hooks wired up | `aipager config` |
| `check_hook_scripts` | `aipager-hook` and `aipager-statusline` are on PATH | `uv tool install --reinstall aipager` |
| `check_daemon` | Daemon is running and socket is responsive | `aipager start` |
| `check_service_installed` | Optional: service unit is present | `aipager service install` |
| `check_service_unit_path` | Linux only: the *installed* unit's `Environment=PATH=` actually contains the resolved claude binary's directory — parsed as text, since doctor cannot see systemd's own PATH from the operator's interactive shell | `aipager service install --yes` |

Run `aipager doctor --fix` to interactively discover/copy a Claude
credential into `daemon.env`, or pin `claude_path` when multiple
installs are found (or the unit's PATH disagrees with the resolved
one). It only ever acts after asking.

## The daemon can't find `claude`, or picks the wrong install

Six places used to resolve `claude` independently and could disagree
with each other. They now all go through one resolver
(`aipager/claude_resolve.py`), in this order: `claude_path` in
`aipager.yaml` → `$AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` → `~/.local/bin/claude` →
every `claude` on `$PATH` → the fixed Homebrew prefixes. Run
`aipager doctor` to see exactly which one it picked and what else it
found; if the wrong one wins, either fix `$PATH` for the process that
launches aipager, or pin the right one explicitly:

```sh
aipager doctor --fix        # interactive picker among discovered installs
# or by hand:
echo 'claude_path: /home/you/.local/bin/claude' >> ~/.config/aipager/aipager.yaml
```

## Sessions can't authenticate under the systemd service, but `claude` works fine in a terminal

`systemctl --user` units never source `~/.bashrc` / `~/.profile`, so
an `export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=…` line there never reaches the
daemon. The service unit instead uses systemd's `LoadCredential=`,
reading `~/.config/aipager/daemon.env` — a plain `KEY=VALUE` file,
0600, created automatically the first time you run
`aipager service install` (copied forward from a legacy `config.env`
if one held a token, otherwise discovered from your login shell once,
otherwise left empty with a warning).

```sh
cat ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env          # see what's there (or isn't)
echo 'CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-...' >> ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env
chmod 600 ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env
aipager service stop && aipager service start
```

See [Security model — The Claude credential](security.md#the-claude-credential--what-actually-protects-it)
for what this file does and doesn't protect against.

## The daemon's control socket moved

`aipager doctor` / `aipager status` used to always look at
`/tmp/aipager.sock`. Under the systemd service the control socket now
lives at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aipager.sock` (falling back to `/tmp` only
when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset — containers, WSL1, minimal distros).
Only this one socket moved; per-session dtach sockets
(`/tmp/claude-dtach-*.sock`) are unaffected. Override with
`AIPAGER_SOCKET_PATH` if you need a specific location.

## Still stuck?

Open an issue at
[github.com/dev-aly3n/aipager/issues](https://github.com/dev-aly3n/aipager/issues)
and include the output of `aipager doctor` plus the last ~50 lines
of `aipager logs`.
