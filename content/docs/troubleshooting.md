# Troubleshooting

Common failures and the fix. When in doubt, run:

```sh
aipager doctor
```

It runs every check below in order and prints the canonical fix
hint for each failure. Source: `aipager/doctor.py`.

## "Another aipager daemon already owns the socket"

Two daemons can't share one control socket. It lives at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aipager.sock` under the systemd service (falls back
to `/tmp/aipager.sock` when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset). If a
previous daemon crashed without unlinking, the new one detects the
stale socket and exits.

```sh
pkill -f 'aipager start'
rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/aipager.sock"
aipager start
```

Or, if you're using the service unit:

```sh
aipager service stop
aipager service start
```

## Telegram bot doesn't respond

1. `aipager status` — is the daemon up? If "daemon down" → start it.
2. `aipager doctor` — the `check_token_valid` and
   `check_chat_reachable` checks ping the Telegram API end-to-end
   and surface the exact error.
3. Wrong chat ID: re-run `aipager config` and re-enter the chat ID
   (open the bot in Telegram, send any message, then check
   `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`).
4. Bot was never `/start`ed: open the bot in Telegram and tap Start
   once.

## Busy cards got slower

Telegram allows roughly one message a second into any one chat (and 20 a
minute into a group). Every message and every edit counts. The daemon
gives each chat its own budget of about 1 call a second, with a small
burst, and the busy cards of that chat **share** it. The "typing…"
indicator is in that budget too, as the **lowest** thing the chat sends
(see "The typing bubble" below).

The bubble's share is set aside first — one call every 4.5 seconds
while the chat's oldest working turn is under ten minutes old, less as it
ages (see "The typing bubble") — and the cards divide what is left.
So a single card in a DM refreshes about every 4.8 seconds; with two
sessions working in the same chat, each card about every 9.7 seconds;
with three, about every 14.5. **A
slower card is the budget working, not a bug.** Answers, replies and
button responses are never slowed to make room for a card — they keep a
reserved token, and a card edit that cannot afford a call is simply
skipped and retried on the next tick rather than queued in front of your
answer.

In a **group** the limit is 20 calls a minute however many sessions are
in it, and the bubble alone would use two thirds of that. The group's
cards together keep one refresh every 10 seconds (11 s for one card), and
the bubble takes the rest — so in a group it can lapse for a second or
two now and then.

To speed the cards up: run fewer simultaneous sessions per chat, or give
the busiest ones a chat of their own (`aipager config`). You can also
tune `STREAM_EDIT_INTERVAL` (default `1.2`, the cadence while the card is
streaming text) and `BUSY_EDIT_INTERVAL` (default `3.0`, when it is
quiet) in your config. Setting either *below* the per-chat floor is
harmless and changes nothing — the floor wins, which is what keeps the
chat under Telegram's limit whatever you put in the file.

### A long turn's card refreshes less often

The cadence above is for the first two minutes of a turn. After that the
card **slows down as the turn gets older**, and its elapsed counter
switches unit so it never looks frozen:

| turn age | card refreshes at most every | counter reads |
|---|---|---|
| 0–2 min | as above (about 4.8 s for one card in a DM) | `45s` |
| 2–10 min | 10 s | `4m 10s` |
| 10–60 min | 30 s | `23m` |
| over 60 min | 60 s | `1h 23m` |

A new tool row or a new sentence waits for the next refresh; a **state
change** — the session going from working to waiting on a background
agent, and back — is shown at once, at most once every 10 seconds. The
live agent rows and the waiting line use the same unit. The finished card
still shows its duration as it always has.

This is what keeps a four-hour turn from editing one message thousands of
times: on 2026-09-23 one card did exactly that, and the chat was banned
for seven hours. To keep the fast cadence for a whole turn, switch off
**`/settings` → ⏱ Long-turn card updates** (for the chat, or per session
from the Mini App or `👤 Per-session preferences`).

### The typing bubble

The "typing…" bubble is sent by **one** loop per chat, however many
sessions are working in it (the bubble is per chat in every Telegram
client), every `TYPING_INDICATOR_INTERVAL` seconds (default 4.5 —
Telegram clears a typing status after 5; `0` turns the bubble off). It
counts in the chat's budget as the lowest thing the chat sends:

- it **slows as the turn gets older**, on the age of the chat's oldest
  working turn: every 4.5 s for the first ten minutes (a steady bubble),
  every 15 s after that — Telegram shows it for 5 s, so an older turn's
  bubble flickers instead of staying lit. At 4.5 s
  it alone would be 800 calls an hour and the hourly limit (below) would
  switch it off for long stretches; switching off **⏱ Long-turn card
  updates** keeps it at 4.5 s;
- it **shows from the start of every turn**; a young card refreshes
  slightly slower to make room — the bubble's share of the chat is set
  aside before the cards divide the rest (above), so the two together
  never exceed the chat's limits;
- it never takes a token a card edit needs: a bubble due just after a
  card edit waits half a second (`TYPING_RETRY_WAKE`) and tries again, so
  it is at most a second or two late, never missing;
- it is the first thing dropped when the chat's hourly volume gets high
  (below);
- a 429 on the bubble itself blocks only the bubble, for as long as
  Telegram asked — the cards carry on — but it does start the chat's
  six-hour warning regime (the rate is capped at 0.5 calls/s, so the
  cards slow down too);
- a **ban** on the bubble (a `retry_after` past the cap below) mutes the
  chat exactly like a ban on any other call: nothing more goes into it,
  and the turn's answer is held and delivered when the ban lifts.

It used to be free (one loop per working session, outside every budget),
until on 2026-09-23 two sessions in one DM had sent it ~5,400 times in
three hours and Telegram rate-limited the bubble itself.

## The bot slowed down: a rate limit (429)

If Telegram rate-limits a chat anyway, it answers one call with `429` and
a `retry_after` of a few seconds. The daemon stops calling that chat for
exactly that long, makes the one deferred send again afterwards, and
**doubles that chat's card interval** (up to ×8). Each quiet minute halves
it back to normal.

What you see:

- `aipager status` (and the `aipager daemon` row of `aipager doctor`)
  shows **`Telegram flood backoff ×4 (chat …), last 429 12 s ago`**.
- Exactly one line in `aipager logs`, with no traceback:
  `flood: chat … 429 retry_after=5s → cadence ×2`.
- Nothing is muted, and **no answer is lost** — it is deferred, not
  dropped.
- The chat's **earned send rate halves**, and the chat enters a
  **six-hour warning regime** (`FLOOD_WARNING_HOURS`): its rate may not
  climb past 0.5 calls/s (`FLOOD_WARNED_CEILING`), and it climbs back
  slowly. `aipager status` shows it:
  `Telegram chat 123: rate 0.25/s (ceiling 0.50/s), 212/1200 calls in the
  last hour (as of 18s ago), 7/30 in the last minute — warning regime,
  5h 52m left`.

Nothing to do. It clears itself. The backoff line disappears once the
chat has been quiet for a minute or two; the rate climbs back by 0.1
calls/s per quiet window — a minute normally, 36 minutes during the
warning regime — and the full ceiling returns when the regime ends.
`aipager doctor` keeps the daemon row green throughout: a chat backing off
is normal operation. (A 429 used to be forgiven in about five
minutes. Telegram's one warning before the 2026-09-23 ban came 3 h 23 min
earlier, and the chat was back at full speed within minutes of it.)

### The hourly budget

Every chat also has a rolling **hour**: at most `FLOOD_HOURLY_MAX` (1200)
calls in any 60 minutes — typing bubbles, card edits and answers alike;
only reactions are exempt. The last 120 (`FLOOD_HOURLY_ESSENTIAL_RESERVE`)
are kept for answers, replies and prompts:

- at 810 calls in the hour the typing bubble pauses (it comes back under
  648);
- at 1080 the chat enters **minimal mode** (below) until the hour frees
  to 864;
- answers are never refused by the hour; if they ever go past 1200, the
  log says so once an hour.

`aipager status` shows the chat's calls in the last hour against its
budget. The figure comes from the state file, which the daemon rewrites
at most once a minute while calls flow, so it is labelled with its age.
Two busy sessions streaming into one DM for hours stay well under the
budget (the 2026-09-23 incident, replayed: ~900 calls in the busiest
hour, against a modelled ~3,400 for the same work without it).

### The earned rate, and why your cards may be slower than they were

Since 0.7.13 each chat's sustained send rate is **learned rather than
assumed**. Telegram does not publish the limit that actually applies to
your bot — it depends on your account's recent history — so the daemon
starts each chat at 0.5 calls/s, adds 0.1 for every quiet minute up to a
ceiling of 1/s, halves it on a 429 and drops it to 0.05 after a ban. A
bot that has just been banned is therefore paced far more carefully than
one that has not, and it earns its speed back over the following hours.

If a chat's rate falls below 0.2 calls/s — or its hourly budget's share
for cards and bubbles is spent — it enters **minimal mode**: busy cards
stop animating and show one static `⏳ working — updates paused` line,
the typing bubble stops, and the pinned status bar shows
`⏸ card updates paused (hourly limit)` (or `(rate limit)` when the rate
is what put the chat there) and otherwise stops changing until it lifts.
**Answers, replies and permission prompts keep flowing** — that is the
point. The card is about 95 % of what this bot sends and the answer about
5 %, so under pressure it sheds pixels rather than work. `aipager doctor`
reports minimal mode as a warning so a paused card is never mistaken for
a broken one; it lifts by itself as the rate recovers.

## The bot went quiet: flood control

A `retry_after` past `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER` (default 90 s) is not a
rate limit — it is a **ban**, and it can run to hours. From the chat it
looks like the bot died: prompts still reach Claude, sessions keep
working, but no reply comes back.

What you see:

- `aipager status` (and the `aipager daemon` row of `aipager doctor`)
  shows **`Telegram flood-muted until HH:MM (chat …)`**.
- One line in `aipager logs`: `Telegram flood control — chat … muted
  for Ns (until HH:MM) …`, then silence for that chat. Later, one
  `flood mute on chat … lifted` line.
- `aipager status` also shows the chat's state in full:
  `Telegram chat 123: rate 0.05/s (ceiling 0.50/s), 431/600 calls in the
  last hour (as of 12s ago) — MINIMAL MODE, card updates paused —
  flood-muted until 09:41 — warning regime, 5h 59m left (1 ban(s) in the
  last 7 days)`.

The daemon mutes the chat for exactly the time Telegram asked and makes
**no call of any kind** to it — answers, busy-card edits, attachments,
reactions, typing indicators, button-tap toasts and the replies your
commands would have produced. Each one would be a fresh violation that
extends the ban; a request into an active ban is what turned a 21-minute
ban into a 9.5-hour one on 2026-09-15. A command typed during a mute
therefore answers with nothing at all, and **a button tap is not
acknowledged either** — up to 0.7.12 the toast still fired, on the theory
that Telegram meters it separately. It does, for pacing; it does not for
bans. Other chats are unaffected.

**Messaging the bot during a ban is safe, and nothing is lost.** Nothing
you do in the chat makes the bot call Telegram while the chat is muted,
so it cannot extend the ban:

- A prompt you send (text, voice, a file, a quick template) still
  reaches Claude and the session works on it. Its busy card is held
  back, not dropped: if the turn is still running when the ban lifts,
  the card appears then. A ban leaves the chat in minimal mode for a
  while afterwards, so the card can take a few minutes longer than the
  ban itself. If the turn finished during the ban you get its answer
  and no card.
- **🔄 Retry** does nothing during a ban. The prompt is not re-sent and
  the button stays, so you can tap it again after the ban lifts. Up to
  and including 0.7.14 the prompt went to Claude while the error
  message and its button stayed, so a second tap sent it again.
- The main keyboard is held back too, including the one a restart sends
  (up to 0.7.14 it was lost until something else refreshed it). It is
  sent after the ban lifts.

After the ban lifts, things arrive in this order: held answers, then
cards for turns still running, then the keyboard. A card that has to
wait for minimal mode to end comes after the keyboard.

**Answers are not lost.** An answer produced while the chat is muted is
held and delivered once the ban lifts, within a couple of seconds, with
its first line reading `⏳ delivered late (held 42 min during a Telegram
rate limit)`. You do not need to ask again — and if you did ask again,
both answers arrive, oldest first: a ban lasting hours spans several
turns and each one's answer is yours. (Held answers live in memory: if
you restart the daemon while any are waiting, they are lost — the
shutdown log says how many. A chat holds at most 20, and nothing older
than 24 hours; anything dropped for either reason is a warning in the
log naming what it was.)

**A ban makes the chat slower afterwards, not faster.** The moment a ban
is armed the chat's learned rate drops to the floor and the ban is
counted; the muted hours earn nothing back, the climb restarts from the
moment the ban lifts, and **for seven days** (`FLOOD_BAN_MEMORY_DAYS`)
the chat's rate ceiling *and* its hourly budget are divided by one plus
the number of bans in that week: one ban halves both, two third them.
`aipager status` shows all of it. (The memory used to be 24 hours
and only halved the ceiling; a chat banned on 2026-09-19 was back at full
speed — and banned for seven hours — on 2026-09-23.) Five or more bans in
a week keep the chat in minimal mode until they age out: answers still
flow, the cards stay paused.

What NOT to do:

- Don't restart the daemon to "fix" it. The mute self-clears at the time
  shown. Since 0.7.13 a restart no longer forgets the ban — the deadline,
  the chat's earned rate and its ban history are persisted to
  `~/.claude/aipager-flood-state.json` and restored on start, and so are
  the chat's last hour of calls and its warning regime — so
  restarting no longer extends it either. But it will throw away any
  answers still held, and it fixes nothing.
- Don't lower `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER` below the default 90 s hoping
  to retry sooner — everything past that cap is a ban, not a rate limit.

To avoid it: run fewer simultaneous sessions per chat, or give the
busiest ones a chat of their own (`aipager config`).

## A session dropped off the pinned status bar (it is GONE)

The dtach process for that session exited (machine reboot,
`pkill claude`, user typed `exit` in the dtach attach session).
Recreate from scratch — its `~/.claude/projects/...` directory still
has the conversation:

The easiest path is `/resume <label>` in Telegram (or bare
`/resume` for a picker) — it relaunches the session and picks the
conversation back up. From the CLI:

```sh
aipager resume <label>             # same thing from the terminal
aipager session <label>            # or a fresh session, no history
aipager session <label> --resume   # fresh dtach, resumed conversation
```

## Permission prompt stuck on INTERACTIVE

If a session sits in INTERACTIVE with no hook activity for >5 min,
the session monitor auto-demotes it to BUSY and clears the pending
permission. This catches the case where claude code crashed
mid-prompt and the user can never respond.

Tune the timeout:

```sh
AIPAGER_INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT=300 aipager start    # in seconds
```

## Voice extra won't install via Telegram

The `[📦 Install voice]` button runs an installer subprocess and
streams the result. If the install fails, the bot replies with the
last 500 chars of stderr. Common causes:

- Network: pip can't reach PyPI. Check connectivity from the daemon
  host.
- Disk: `~/.cache/huggingface/` needs ~74 MB for the model and
  pip's wheel cache another ~250 MB. Free space first.
- Permission denied: read-only venv. Switch to `uv tool install`
  which always uses a user-owned venv.

If the bot lost connection mid-install, the install itself usually
completed on the host — restart the daemon and try a voice message
again.

## Open App shows "Open this page from the Telegram app to sign in"

The page loaded, but Telegram's Mini App SDK script (the one that
produces `initData`) did not, so the page has nothing to sign in with
and makes no API call at all. The message blames you; the cause is a
network one.

Recent versions of aipager fetch that script themselves and serve it
from the page's own origin (`/telegram-web-app.js`), so the phone only
needs to reach the host that delivered the page — not `telegram.org` as
well. If you see this on an older version, upgrade.

Then, in order:

1. Look at the page source. If its `<script>` tag points at
   `https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js`, the daemon has not
   managed to fetch the script yet and the page is falling back to
   loading it from Telegram — which is the case that fails on a phone
   that cannot reach `telegram.org`. The daemon fetches it when the Mini
   App server starts and retries at most once a day, so restarting the
   daemon retries immediately; `journalctl --user -u aipager | grep
   "webapp sdk"` says what went wrong (a blocked or filtered
   `telegram.org`, usually).
2. If the tag points at `/telegram-web-app.js`, check the daemon serves
   it: `curl -sI http://127.0.0.1:8765/telegram-web-app.js` on the
   daemon host (adjust the port if you changed it) should answer `200`
   with `Content-Type: application/javascript`. The copy lives under
   `~/.local/share/aipager/webapp-sdk/`.
3. You opened the URL in a regular browser rather than from the bot's
   `/app` button or menu button: that is the expected message. The SDK
   only produces `initData` inside Telegram.
4. The page was left open for more than five minutes: `initData`
   expires and the page asks to be reopened. Tap `/app` again.

## `pyexpat _XML_SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold` on brew install

Homebrew's `python@3.12` bottle was compiled against a newer
libexpat than your system has — almost always because **Xcode and
Command Line Tools are out of date** on macOS Tahoe (26.x). Brew's
own output usually tells you so. Two fixes:

- **Use `uv tool install aipager`** instead. uv bundles its own
  python, dodging the issue entirely. This is the recommended path
  on macOS — see the [README](../README.md#install).
- **Update Xcode + Command Line Tools**:
  ```sh
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install
  ```
  Or open Xcode in the App Store and update to the latest.

## "ModuleNotFoundError: aipager"

Your daemon binary references a Python that no longer has aipager
installed (often after a venv wipe). Reinstall:

```sh
uv tool install --reinstall aipager
# or whichever installer you started with: pipx, brew, pip
```

## Daemon crashes on boot with `KeyError` in `state.py`

State file got corrupted (interrupted write). The daemon doesn't
auto-recover destructive corruption — restore the latest backup:

```sh
ls -la ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json.bak.*
# pick the most recent, then:
cp ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json.bak.<timestamp> \
   ~/.claude/aipager-sessions.json
aipager start
```

If no backup is recoverable, you can safely delete the state file —
the daemon will recover live sessions by scanning
`/tmp/claude-dtach-*.sock` on first monitor tick.

## A session launch fails

A launch dtach refuses shows a one-line reason in chat (socket already
exists, shell not executable, no pseudo-terminal, name too long,
permission denied, missing directory); dtach's own message, paths
included, is in `aipager logs`.

## `aipager doctor` check list

The order matters — each later check assumes earlier ones passed.
A check that crashes on an unexpected environment shows as a single
⚠ row naming the check and the error; the remaining checks still run.

| Check | What it verifies | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|
| `check_config` | `~/.config/aipager/aipager.yaml` exists and has token + chat ID | `aipager config` |
| `check_token_valid` | Token works against Telegram `getMe` | re-run `aipager config` |
| `check_chat_reachable` | Bot can send to the configured chat | open bot, tap Start |
| `check_dtach` | `dtach` binary on PATH | `uv tool install --reinstall aipager` |
| `check_claude` | Resolves the `claude` binary via the same precedence chain every launch uses (`claude_path` config → `$AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` → `~/.local/bin` → PATH → Homebrew), and lists every OTHER distinct install found | install Claude Code, or set `claude_path` / `AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` |
| `check_claude_auth` | Probes `claude auth status` in the same environment a real session gets. **Never FAILs** — "not logged in" and "the probe itself failed" are reported distinctly, and neither stops a session from launching | `claude auth login`, or set an API key / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` |
| `check_settings_json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` has the aipager hooks wired up | `aipager config` |
| `check_hook_scripts` | `aipager-hook` and `aipager-statusline` are on PATH | `uv tool install --reinstall aipager` |
| `check_daemon` | Daemon is running and socket is responsive | `aipager start` |
| `check_service_installed` | Optional: service unit is present | `aipager service install` |
| `check_service_unit_path` | Linux only: the *installed* unit's `Environment=PATH=` actually contains the resolved claude binary's directory — parsed as text, since doctor cannot see systemd's own PATH from the operator's interactive shell | `aipager service install --yes` |

Run `aipager doctor --fix` to interactively discover/copy a Claude
credential into `daemon.env`, or pin `claude_path` when multiple
installs are found (or the unit's PATH disagrees with the resolved
one). It only ever acts after asking.

## The daemon can't find `claude`, or picks the wrong install

Six places used to resolve `claude` independently and could disagree
with each other. They now all go through one resolver
(`aipager/claude_resolve.py`), in this order: `claude_path` in
`aipager.yaml` → `$AIPAGER_CLAUDE_BIN` → `~/.local/bin/claude` →
every `claude` on `$PATH` → the fixed Homebrew prefixes. Run
`aipager doctor` to see exactly which one it picked and what else it
found; if the wrong one wins, either fix `$PATH` for the process that
launches aipager, or pin the right one explicitly:

```sh
aipager doctor --fix        # interactive picker among discovered installs
# or by hand:
echo 'claude_path: /home/you/.local/bin/claude' >> ~/.config/aipager/aipager.yaml
```

## Sessions can't authenticate under the systemd service, but `claude` works fine in a terminal

`systemctl --user` units never source `~/.bashrc` / `~/.profile`, so
an `export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=…` line there never reaches the
daemon. The service unit instead uses systemd's `LoadCredential=`,
reading `~/.config/aipager/daemon.env` — a plain `KEY=VALUE` file,
0600, created automatically the first time you run
`aipager service install` (copied forward from a legacy `config.env`
if one held a token, otherwise discovered from your login shell once,
otherwise left empty with a warning).

```sh
cat ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env          # see what's there (or isn't)
echo 'CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-...' >> ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env
chmod 600 ~/.config/aipager/daemon.env
aipager service stop && aipager service start
```

See [Security model — The Claude credential](security.md#the-claude-credential--what-actually-protects-it)
for what this file does and doesn't protect against.

## The daemon's control socket moved

`aipager doctor` / `aipager status` used to always look at
`/tmp/aipager.sock`. Under the systemd service the control socket now
lives at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aipager.sock` (falling back to `/tmp` only
when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset — containers, WSL1, minimal distros).
Only this one socket moved; per-session dtach sockets
(`/tmp/claude-dtach-*.sock`) are unaffected. Override with
`AIPAGER_SOCKET_PATH` if you need a specific location.

## `/update` says the restart would kill sessions (KillMode)

Service units written before this version have no `KillMode=` line, so
systemd uses `control-group`: stopping or restarting `aipager.service`
kills every Claude session the daemon launched. `/update` therefore
installs the new version but does not restart the daemon, and lists the
sessions a restart would take down. Fix it once:

```
aipager service install
```

It rewrites the unit with `KillMode=process`, reloads systemd, and
restarts the daemon — and that restart already runs under the new
setting. Check with
`systemctl --user show -p KillMode aipager.service` (`KillMode=process`).
With it, systemd logs "left-over process" lines for your sessions on
every restart; that is expected.

## `aipager update` can't find uv / pipx

`aipager update` finds the installer by absolute path in your `PATH`
plus `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, the Homebrew prefixes, `/usr/bin`
and `/bin`. If it still says it could not find `pipx`, the installer
that created this aipager is gone or lives elsewhere; reinstall with the
tool you have (`pipx install --force aipager`,
`uv tool install --reinstall aipager`).

## Update refused: editable / not your install

`/update` and `aipager update` only upgrade an install owned and
writable by your own user, through the installer that created it. They
refuse, and name the reason, for:

- an editable (development) checkout — update it with `git pull`;
- a Nix, Snap, Docker or OS-package install — use that system's own
  update;
- an install owned by another user (for example a root-owned venv under
  `/opt`) — update it as that user.

## Updated, but the version didn't change

A pipx install made from a local path (`pipx install /path/to/aipager`)
upgrades from that same path, not from PyPI. `/update` says
`already at A — this pipx install upgrades from the local path …`. Pull
or check out the new version there first, or switch to PyPI with
`pipx install --force aipager`. (The voice extra's install button uses
`pipx install --force aipager[voice]`, which also switches a local-path
install to PyPI.)

## The daemon didn't come back after an update

The upgrade checks that the new version imports before any restart, but
if the new daemon still fails to start, systemd keeps retrying every
5 s. Look at why:

```
journalctl --user -u aipager.service -n 50
```

Reinstall the previous version with the same installer, then restart:

```
pipx install --force aipager==<previous>        # or:
uv tool install --force aipager==<previous>     # or:
<venv>/bin/python -m pip install aipager==<previous>
systemctl --user restart aipager.service
```

A local-path pipx install: `pipx install --force /path/to/aipager` at
the old commit. If a stale announcement is pending, remove it with
`rm -f ~/.local/share/aipager/update-restart.json` (it is ignored after
24 h anyway); `~/.local/share/aipager/update.lock` is only a lock file
and is safe to delete when no update is running.

## "An update was interrupted when aipager shut down"

The daemon stopped (or was restarted) while `/update` was installing, and
the installer was stopped with it, so the install may be half-written. If
aipager or Claude Code misbehaves, repair it: for aipager, run the
reinstall command from the message (for example
`pipx install --force aipager`) and then
`systemctl --user restart aipager.service`; for Claude Code, run
`claude update` again.

## Still stuck?

Open an issue at
[github.com/dev-aly3n/aipager/issues](https://github.com/dev-aly3n/aipager/issues)
and include the output of `aipager doctor` plus the last ~50 lines
of `aipager logs`.
